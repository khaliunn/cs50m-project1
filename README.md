# CS50M Project 1 - Pomodoro Timer

This project is a part of [CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native). You can find the project specifications [here](https://docs.cs50.net/mobile/2020/x/projects/1/project1.html).

### Basic Functionality

The timer allows users to alternate between 25 minutes of "work" and 5 minutes of "break", and the user can start, stop, and reset the timer.

### Future Development

At some point, I'll try and implement the challenge part of the project, which is to develop a functionality that allows users to input any duration of "work" and "break".
